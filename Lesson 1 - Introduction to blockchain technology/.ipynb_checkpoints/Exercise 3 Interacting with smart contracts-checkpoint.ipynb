    "This is very important for solidity and other blockchains in general since, as an emerging technologies, the state of the art is constantly and fastly upgrading, and so great differences can be found between versions. In this case, we are saying that we will use only instructions that can be compiled by a version of solc which is 0.4.23 or above. (take a look at the intial 0, this means it is still in a \"initial development\" phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "I line three, there is the contract definition. A contract is similar to an object (for those who know object programming), look at it like a library containing specific internal variables and functions, (which are often used for modifying the internal variables). In the \"Storage\" smart contract we have one internal variable and two functions: *myNumber*, *saveNumber* and *getNumber*. In the following we will look at every line:\n",
    "- **uint num:** an internal variable called *num*, which is (and it would always be) an unsigned integer. In ethereum, unsigned integer have a lenght of 256 bits, so they can codify integers between 0 and $2^{256} - 1$.\n",
    "- **function store(uint a) public:** this line defines a function, that will perform the actions between braces. The instruction *function* specifies that the following is a function, called *store*, which takes as input an *uint*. This uint will be referred as \"*a*\" in all the code between the function braces. Finally, the term *public* means that this function can be called by anyone which has acces to the blockchain (this means potentially eeryone in the universe). This function consists in two instructions. described in the followinf lines.\n",
    "- **require(a < 10):** the first one, require, checks if the number *a* is < than 10. If yes, the following instruction is performed, otherwise it stops the execution. As we will see later, require is very powerful and can be used to applya wide range of contraints to our functions. \n",
    "- **myNumber = a:** finally, the core of our function. Here it is very simple, since is sets the *num* contract parameter as the number *a* we just passed. Notice that both *a* and *num* are of the same type (uint).\n",
    "- **function retreive() public view returns(uint):** another function, *retreive*, which is also public. The new instruction, *view*, means that it does not perform any change in the blockchain memory (since it does not change anything in the contract, but just reads and returns a value). Also, it returns a value, which we state it will be a uint variable. This function performs just one thing:\n",
    "- **return num:** Just reads the current value of the contract parameter *num*, and returns it back. In this way, calling the function *retreive* we will be able to access to the number stored in the contract."
